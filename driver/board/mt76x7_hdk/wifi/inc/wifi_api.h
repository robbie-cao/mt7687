 * @{
 * This section introduces the Wi-Fi driver APIs including terms and acronyms, supported features,
 * software architecture, details on how to use this driver, Wi-Fi function groups, enumerations,
 * structures and functions. The Wi-Fi APIs are divided into three categories:
 * Profile, Configure and Connect.
 *
 * Profile APIs are used to get/set the profile in the Flash memory. The profile settings can be read by
 * Wi-Fi profile get APIs. The profile settings can be used to initialize the Wi-Fi
 * driver configuration at system boot up. There are many profile sections in the Flash memory, such as:
 * STA, AP, common. Use the same profile section for #WIFI_PORT_STA/#WIFI_PORT_APCLI.
 *
 * Configure APIs are used to get and set the Wi-Fi driver configuration. In most cases they take effect
 * immediately, but there are some configuration APIs that only take
 * effect by calling wifi_config_reload_setting() API, such as: \n
 * wifi_config_set_pmk() \n
 * wifi_config_set_security_mode() \n
 * wifi_config_set_ssid() \n
 * wifi_config_set_wep_key() \n
 * wifi_config_set_wpa_psk_key() \n
 * The configure APIs use in-band mechanism (in-band is a mechanism used for Wi-Fi driver and Wi-Fi Firmware communication),
 * thus these APIs must be called after OS task scheduler is started to make sure an in-band task is running.
 * The function #wifi_config_register_rx_handler() registers wifi_rx_handler() to manage the raw packet. There is a limitation calling this handler as it's using an in-band mechanism,
 * it's restricted to call any in-band functions like Wi-Fi configure or Wi-Fi connect APIs in wifi_rx_handler().
 *
 * The connect APIs are used to manage the link status, such as: disconnect AP, disconnect the station, get the link status, get the station list, start/stop scan.
 * Register event handler for scan/connect/disconnect event. The connect APIs use an in-band mechanism, thus these APIs must be called after the OS Task
 * scheduler is started, to make sure an in-band task is running.

This method is the mandatory baseline mode and everything must support it. The Wi-Fi direct specification supersedes this requirement by stating that all devices with a keypad or display must support the PIN method.|

* \b 0                        | CAM: CAM (Constantly Awake Mode) is a power save mode that keeps the radio powered up continuously to ensure there is a minimal lag in response time. This power save setting consumes the most power but offers the highest throughput.|
* \b 1                        | LEGACY_POWERSAVE: the access point buffers incoming messages for the radio. The radio occasionally 'wakes up' to determine if any buffered messages are waiting and then returns to sleep mode after it requests each message. This setting conserves the most power but also provides the lowest throughput. It is recommended for radios in which power consumption is the most important (such as small battery-operating devices).|
* \b 2                        | FAST_POWERSAVE: Fast is a power save mode that switches between power saving and CAM modes, depending on the network traffic. For example, it switches to CAM when receiving a large number of packets and switches back to PS mode after the packets have been retrieved. Fast is recommended when power consumption and throughput are a concern.|
