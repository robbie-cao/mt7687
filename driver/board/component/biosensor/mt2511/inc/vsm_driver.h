 * |------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * |\b VSM                        | Vital signs (or vitals) are used to measure the body's basic functions. For more information, please check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_signs"> Vital signs in wiki </a>.|
 * |\b MT2511                     | MT2511 is a 2-in-1 bio-sensing AFE (analog front-end) to facilitate bio-signal acquisition. The AFE comprises of low noise voltage and current sensing channels and is capable of sensing EKG (Electrocardiography) and PPG (Photoplethysmography) simultaneously.|
 * |\b EKG                        | Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG) is the process of recording the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time using electrodes placed on a patient's body.|
 * |\b EEG                        | Electroencephalography (EEG) is an electrophysiological monitoring method to record electrical activity of the brain.|
 * |\b EMG                        | Electromyography (EMG) is an electrodiagnostic medicine technique for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles.|
 * |\b GSR                        | Galvanic skin response (GSR) is an electrophysiological monitoring method to record conductance of the skin.|
 * |\b PPG                        | Photoplethysmogram (PPG) is an optical volumetric measurement of an organ. By illuminating skin with LED, the PPG is measured from the light transmitted or reflected to photodiode.|
 * |\b BISI                       | Beat interval (BI) and signal integrity (SI) detection. The BI is computed based on subtracting the peak position of the successive PPG beats. The SI is an indicator to identify the PPG signal integrity.|
 * |\b TIA                        | Trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) converts the input photodiode current into an appropriate voltage.|
 * |\b AMBDAC                     | Ambient cancellation digital-to-analog converter (AMBDAC) is a kind of Ambient Cancellation Scheme, the receiver provides digital samples corresponding to ambient duration. The host processor (external to the AFE) can use these ambient values to estimate the amount of ambient light leakage.|
 * |\b PGA                        | Programmable gain amplifier (PGA) is an electronic amplifier (typically an operational amplifier) whose gain can be controlled by external digital or analog signals.|
 *
 * @section Features_Chapter Supported features
 *
 * - \b EKG \b Channel. \n
 *   MT2511 integrates a high-resolution DC-coupled front end. It can endure wide input offset, large interference and different electrode impedance. Besides right leg drive mode, it supports a two-electrode mode for reducing electrode cost. Note that there is larger interference during the two-electrode mode. \n
 *   \n
 * - \b PPG \b Channel. \n
 *   MT2511 consists of LED drivers, a high-end DC-coupled current-mode front end and a flexible timing control for the PPG channel. The flexible timing control enables the users to control the device timing for different applications and to power down the device for power saving operations. The PPG front-end can sense up to four channels (two for signal and two for ambient) by time multiplexing. \n
 *
 * @section Architecture_Chapter Software architecture of the VSM
 *
 * The diagram below shows the software architecture of the VSM. \n
 * - Call #vsm_driver_init() to initialize the hardware. After the VSM is initialized, software needs to call
 *  #vsm_driver_set_signal() to set the biosignals to be sensed by the VSM. Call #vsm_driver_read_sram() to get sensed results.
 *  This architecture is extensible, it can be modified to support other VSM.
 * @image html biosensor_architecture_image_name.png
 *
 * @section Driver_Usage_Chapter How to use this driver
 *
 * - Use VSM to read bio data. \n
 *  - step1: Call #vsm_driver_init() to intialize the VSM hardware.
 *  - step2: Call #vsm_driver_set_signal() to set the VSM sensing signal.
 *  - step3: Call #vsm_driver_read_sram() to read the VSM data from the SRAM.
 *  - step4: Call #vsm_driver_deinit() to de-initialize VSM hardware, if it is no longer in use.
 *  - Sample code:
 *    @code
 *       uint32_t data_buf[VSM_SRAM_LEN];
 *       int32_t len;
 *       ret = vsm_driver_init();//Initialize the VSM hardware to power on the VSM.
 *       if (ret == VSM_STATUS_OK) {
 *           ret = vsm_driver_set_signal(VSM_SIGNAL_EKG); //Set the EKG as VSM sensing signal.
 *           if (VSM_STATUS_OK != ret) {
 *                //error handle
 *           } else {
 *               vsm_driver_read_sram(VSM_SRAM_EKG, data_buf, &len); //Places the SRAM data to the data_buf with len length.
 *           }
 *       }
 *
 *       //De-initialize the VSM hardware.
 *       vsm_driver_deinit();
 *    @endcode
 *
 * @section Function_Group_Chapter VSM function groups
 *
 * The APIs are grouped by functionality, for an easier use.
 * - The VSM hardware initialize/de-initialize functions. \n The #vsm_driver_init() function initializes and powers on the VSM.
 *   Call the #vsm_driver_init() API before selecting the sensing signals. The #vsm_driver_deinit() disables the VSM hardware
 *   The functions are:
 *  - #vsm_driver_init()
 *  - #vsm_driver_deinit()
 *
 * - Selecting the signals.  \n The #vsm_driver_set_signal() API function selects the sensing signal of the VSM.
 *   The function is:
 *  - #vsm_driver_set_signal()
 *
 * - VSM read and write register functions.  \n The #vsm_driver_read_register() function reads the register value from assigned address.
 *   The #vsm_driver_write_register() function writes the value to the register from assigned address. The functions are:
 *  - #vsm_driver_read_register()
 *  - #vsm_driver_write_register()
 *
 * - Read SRAM.  \n The #vsm_driver_read_sram() API can get the latest  SRAM data by SRAM type.
 *   Call #vsm_driver_set_signal() to generate biosensing data to the SRAM with the status set to enable, then call #vsm_driver_read_sram() to get the SRAM data. The function is:
 *  - #vsm_driver_read_sram()
 *
 * - Other settings.  \n Apply the following functions to adjust various settings..
 *   The functions are:
 *  - #vsm_driver_set_led_current()
 *  - #vsm_driver_set_tia_gain()
 *  - #vsm_driver_set_ambdac_current()
 *  - #vsm_driver_set_pga_gain()
 *
