* |Terms                   |Details                                                                 |

* |\b ADC                        | ADC is an Analog-to-Digital Converter that converts a continuous physical quantity (usually voltage) to a digital number that represents the quantity's amplitude.|
* |\b OCV                        | The Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) is voltage of a device when disconnected from any circuit.|
* |\b PMU                        | The Power Management Unit (PMU) is a microcontroller that governs power functions of digital platforms.|
* |\b AUXADC                     | Auxiliary ADC|

*
* The charger controller senses the charger input voltage from either a standard AC-DC adaptor or an USB charger.
* When the charger input voltage is within a pre-determined range, the charging process will be activated.
* This detector resists higher input voltages than other parts of PMU.
*   \n \n
* - \b Charger \b Detection \n
* Whenever an invalid charging source is detected (> 7.0 V), the charger detector stops the charging process immediately
* to avoid burning out the chip or the device. In addition, if the charger-in level is not high enough (< 4.3V),
* the charger will also be disabled to avoid improper charging behavior.
*   \n \n
* - \b Charging  \b Control \n
* When the charger is active, the charger controller manages the charging phase according to the battery status.
* During the charging period, the battery voltage is constantly monitored. The battery charger supports pre-charge mode
* (VBAT < 3.2V, PMU power-off state), CC mode (constant current mode or fast charging mode at the range 3.2V < VBAT < 4.2V)
* and CV mode (constant voltage mode) to optimize the charging procedure for Li-ion battery.
*
*
* @section HAL_Charger_Driver_Usage_Chapter How to use this driver
*
* - \b Using \b Charger. \n
*  The steps are shown below:
*  - Step1: Call #hal_charger_init() to initialization charger hardware setup.
*  - Step2: Call #hal_charger_set_charging_current() to set charging current.
*  - Step3: Call #hal_charger_set_constant_voltage() to set constant voltage charging mode voltage.
*  - Step4: Call #hal_charger_set_high_voltage_threshold() to set high voltage threshold, this is set as default and the configuration is optional.
*  - Step5: Call #hal_charger_enable() to enable charging
*  - Step6: Call #hal_charger_reset_watchdog_timer() to reset watchdog timer before watchdog timeout.
*  - sample code:
*    @code
*    {
        hal_charger_init();
        hal_charger_set_charging_current(HAL_CHARGE_CURRENT_450_MA);
        hal_charger_set_constant_voltage(HAL_BATTERY_VOLT_04_2000_V);
        hal_charger_set_high_voltage_threshold(HAL_BATTERY_VOLT_07_0000_V);
        hal_charger_enable(true);
        hal_charger_reset_watchdog_timer();
