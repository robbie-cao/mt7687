 * @section OHRM_Usage_Chapter How to use OHRM APIs
 * Step 1: Call #ohrm_init() to initialize the OHRM library. The input value should have the correct representation of 1 g-force data. \n
 * Step 2: Call #ohrm_process() when PPG data or motion data is received. \n 
 * Step 3: Call #ohrm_get_bpm() to get the heart rate BPM value, after the PPG data has been processed by #ohrm_process(). \n
 *
