* @addtogroup sensor_fusion_algorithm_interface Sensor fusion algorithm interface
* @{
* The sensor fusion algorithm interface enables to plug in sensors such as pedometer and
* activity recognition and apply the fusion algorithms. The fusion algorithm is available in a library format.
* The APIs could be utilized to easily feed the physical sensor data into fusion algorithms
* and obtain the results based on the various application needs.
* @section sensor_fusion_algorithm_interface_usage_chapter How to use sensor fusion algorithm interface
*
* Below is an example of the pedometer fusion algorithm (requiring accelerometer of 50 Hz sampling rate) registration.
* The steps are shown below:
*  - Step1: Prepare the #sensor_descriptor_t for the pedometer.
*  - Step2: Set the required input sensor.
*  - Step3: Register the pedometer fusion algorithm using #sensor_fusion_algorithm_register_type().
*  - Step4: Register the data buffer using #sensor_fusion_algorithm_register_data_buffer(). Please refer to sensor_manager_t in <sdk_root>/middleware/MTK/sensor_subsys/src/sensor_manager.c for data buffer allocation.
*  - Sample code:
*    @code
* static sensor_input_list_t input_comp_acc;
* static int32_t get_pedometer_result(sensor_data_t *const output)
* {
*     //Return the pedometer result.
