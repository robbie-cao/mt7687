 * This section introduces the GNSS interface APIs including terms and acronyms, supported features, software architecture, details on how to use the GNSS interface, GNSS function groups, enums, structures and functions.
 * The GNSS interface for MediaTek MT2523 hardware development kit(HDK) wraps the data transferred to or from the GNSS chip. 
 * The interface provides a unified method to translate data with GNSS chip.
 * For more details on the data format, data flow and other information on GNSS, please refer to the developer's guide (SDK_GNSS_Dev_Guide.docx).

 * |\b UTC                  | Coordinated Universal Time is the primary time standard to adjust world clocks and time. For an introduction to UTC, please refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC_offset"> UTC in Wikipedia.</a>.|
 * |\b NMEA                 | National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA 0183) is a combined electrical and data specification for communication between marine electronic devices such as echo sounder, sonar, anemometer, gyrocompass, autopilot, GNSS receivers and many other types of instruments. For an introduction to NMEA, please refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183"> NMEA in Wikipedia.</a>.|
 * |\b UART                 | Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter is usually an individual (or part of an) integrated circuit (IC) used for serial communications over a micro-controller unit(MCU) or peripheral device serial port. For an introduction to UART, please refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uart"> UART in Wikipedia.</a>.|
 * |\b PMTK                 | PMTK command is MediaTek proprietary data transfer protocol for GNSS. It enables configuring the parameters of the GNSS chipset, aiding assistance position information and receive notifications from the GNSS chip.</a>.|

 *
 * @section GNSS_Architechture_Chapter Software Architecture of GNSS.
 * The GNSS chip is a System-in-Package (SiP) in MediaTek MT2523 HDK that connects with the host using UART.
 *
 * @section GNSS_Usage_Chapter How to use GNSS interface.
 * - step 1: Call #gnss_init() to initialize the GNSS context and register a callback function.
 * - step 2: Call #gnss_power_on() to power on the GNSS chip.
 * - step 3: Call #gnss_send_command() to configure GNSS chip parameter, such as aiding time.
 * - step 4: Call #gnss_read_sentence() to read the incoming NMEA data.
 * - step 5: Call #gnss_power_off() to power off the GNSS chip.
 * - Sample code:
 * @code
 * int32_t rx_data_ready = 0;
 * int32_t tx_data_ready = 1;
 * void my_callback_func(gnss_callback_type_t type, void *param)
 * {
 *     if (type == GNSS_NOTIFICATION_TYPE_READ) {
 *         //The incoming NMEA sentence is available to read.

 *         rx_data_ready = 1;
 *     }
